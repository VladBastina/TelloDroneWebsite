This Angular application is designed with three main components and one service:

MenuComponent: Provides a simple navigation menu.

CameraComponent: Connects to the camera and manages gesture recognition.

ChatComponent: Enables a basic chat interface for user interactions.

The ServerConnectionService handles communication with the backend server.

Application Structure

The application is structured into components and services. Each component serves a specific role, and the service acts as the communication bridge with the server.

Components

1. MenuComponent

Purpose: The MenuComponent provides a navigation menu allowing users to switch between the camera and chat interfaces.

Functionality: Contains buttons for navigation.

Explanation: It uses Angular's Router to navigate to different components when a button is clicked.

Key Features:

A button to navigate to the camera view.

A button to navigate to the chat interface.

2. CameraComponent

Purpose: The CameraComponent interfaces with the device's camera to enable gesture recognition.

Functionality:

Initializes the camera on load.

Displays the camera feed to the user.

Explanation: This component uses the browser's getUserMedia API to access the camera and show the video feed in a <video> element.

Key Features:

Real-time video display.

Displays on a list next to the camera the result of the hand sign shown to the camera.

3. ChatComponent

Purpose: The ChatComponent provides a simple chat interface for sending and receiving messages.

Functionality:

Allows the user to input messages.

Displays sent and received messages.

Explanation: The component uses two-way data binding for the input field and a method to send messages to the server via the service.

Key Features:

Dynamic list of messages.

Integration with the backend for responses.

Service

ConnectionService

Purpose: Manages all backend communication.

Functionality:

Sends chat messages to the server.

Retrieves responses from the server.

Sends the frame received from the camera to the server and receives the sign shown in it.

Explanation: The service uses IOSockets to comunicate with the server.

Key Features:

Simplifies API calls for components.

Provides a central place to manage backend interaction.

AppModule Configuration

Explanation:

The AppModule is the root module of the application. It declares all the components, imports necessary Angular modules, and sets up routing between components.

Key Elements:

Components:

MenuComponent

CameraComponent

ChatComponent

Routing:

Configures routes for the menu, camera, and chat views.

Imports:

BrowserModule for basic Angular functionality.

FormsModule for form handling (e.g., chat input).

HttpClientModule for backend communication.

Tips for Usage

Navigation:
